# Audio Broadcast on iOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/forsamling/audio-broadcast-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/forsamling/audio-broadcast-ios)

~Broadcast audio over Wi-Fi and~ listen to [Audio Broadcast](https://github.com/forsamling/audio-broadcast) on iOS devices.

The sermon and the translation of the sermon is performed simultaneously at times.

This app was made for the translator to broadcast the translation on the local Wi-Fi network during the sermon, and for the attendees needing translation to listen in on the translation.

Audio Broadcast supports multiple translators at the same time, for multiple languages.

The translator uses Audio Broadcast to stream his own voice.
The attendees uses Audio Broadcast to pick a language and listen in.
